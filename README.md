Seminar at TU Vienna: Contact Tracing, Epidemiology, Mathematical Modeling

Author: Felix Gigler



Installation:
	install miniconda, then (in Anaconda Terminal):

	conda install numpy matplotlib networkx scipy ffmpeg

Note for visualizations:
	beginninng with 07.01.2021 I try to name visualizations such that at some point it includes <nr of nodes>_<p> in order to keep track of network params

Note for experiments:
	if nothing happens when calling "simple_experiment", chances are that the results for these params are already computed and pickled in 'Experiments' folder.

Some notes about experiments are in "notes.txt" inside the experiments folder!
