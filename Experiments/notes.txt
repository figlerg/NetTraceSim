n1000p0.1 vs n1000p0.02
	the curve is just a little flatter with low p, but all in all not a lot of difference between "more social" 
	and "less social" population

	TODO does the mechanic make sense? (each contact is one friend sampled randomly from the available friends)

TODO even at 30 iterations in monte carlo, the curve looks imperfect at times (see 250/0.025 plot).
	maybe I should redo the network in each iteration as well? This is costly, though

n1000p0.1 vs n250p0.4 vs n200p0.5 (same number of friends)
	VERY interesting. quantitatively, these are extremely similar (all converge toward the same state when looking at the ratio of the compartments)
	only difference is the speed of the epidemic- smaller population converges faster than higher population. But in the end, the same fraction of 
		the population has been infected at some point.

n1000p0.1 vs n2000p0.1
	no real surprises there, higher population with equal chance of being friends results in a big, well connected network
	everybody gets infected in the big net. Only interesting thing is that until a certain point in time, the curves look alike.
	small populus stops then, while the big one continues to get infected



MECHANICS:
	- right now, quarantine could end before person is recovered (random variables). Should I assume the quarantine ends only with a negative test?
